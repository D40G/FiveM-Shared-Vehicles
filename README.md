# FiveM Shared Vehicles
 A helpful tool to help with making vehicles.lua files for qb-core.

### Usage:

If you have a FiveM folder that has a bunch of different vehicle folders in it, run the **filelist.bat** in that folder. This file assumes that all folder names are the spawn code of the vehicle. 

This will create a file named **filelist.txt**, which is basically just all of the different folder names. Copy the contents of that into the **cars.txt** file, save it, and then run the python script by right clicking in the folder that **Car.py** is located in, and type ***py Car.py***. 

[Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) can be downloaded from that link.

Alternatively, you can also type each spawn code in manually, such as the example in the **cars.txt** file.

If you wish to quit the program at any time, do not close the terminal window or it may not save your progress. Type **quit** in any of the prompts to quit.

The price will need to be edited at a later time, and by default the shop each is set to is PDM.
